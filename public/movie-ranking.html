<h1>The Best Movies according to Krani</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Aavesham</h3>
<p>The comedy scenes are so spontaneous and the action is well choreographed. At the soul of this movie lies in two things one is fahad's performance and the second is Sushin Shyam's music. Sushin's music uplifts the movie to another level.</p>
<h3>Manjummel Boys</h3>
<p>A group of friends get into a daring rescue mission to save their friend from Guna Caves, a perilously deep pit from where nobody has ever been brought back.</p>
<h3>Premalu</h3>
<p>Premalu is such a blissful watch for literally people of any age!! The movie comes with a simple yet fruitful story line that has been portrayed very pleasingly.</p>
